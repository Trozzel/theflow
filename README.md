# theflow - Getting Things Done based life guiding tool

## Taken largely from the [OmniFocus](https://omnifocus.com) workflow ...
What sets OmniFocus apart from other task management tools is the operational theory that the human mind is a much better CPU than it is a hard drive. 
That is, it lets you focus on one thing at a time, while allowing your brain the freedom to rest, having confidence that your system works.

The old theory that by simply reminding your / myself at a certain time of a given task,

which is based upon the [Getting Things DoneÂ®](https://gettingthingsdone.com), **theflow** enables you to only focus on what's important _right now!_.
